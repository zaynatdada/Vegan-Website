                So glad to have found this gem! Couldn’t have been more impressed! Absolutely beautiful building with amazing decor and lots of plants inside, very Instagram friendly if that’s what you’re looking for. We were greeted with amazing service, and they had great allergen knowledge and were happy to explain everything I could eat on the menu. Everything is vegan (so all dairy-free) and they were able to make great gluten-free substitutions. Best gluten-free bread I’ve ever had in a restaurant. And the vegan cheese, oh wow, It’s the first vegan cheese to fully satisfy this blue cheese lover! My sister and mum enjoyed amazing warm pastries and couldn’t believe they were vegan. Even the drinks were lovely with the hot fresh apples with lots of cinnamon.

    222 Vegan Cuisine
    </div>
    Went there with my vegan friend (I'm not vegan myself) and the food was amazing and affordable! A lot of good dessert options are also available. I had the Oyster Mushroom Raclette and my friend had the 222 Fresh Burger. We also had the baked plantain which was gorgeous. It was not oily at all as I have experienced before in different places. The Oyster Mushroom Raclette was very flavoursome and the textures were perfect. I also tried my friend's GF burger which was so delicious! In the end, we had a lovely coffee and some desserts. I had the Chocolate Gateau and my friend had the Apple Crumble. I would recommend it to everyone with specific dietary requirements or someone who just wants to have something healthy and yet tasty from time to time.

        Farmacy

        Book a table at the Farmacy for fantastic vegan food that is designed to be as healthy as possible. The ingredients are very fresh. We ate Pumpkin soup, kale salad, and ramen with fresh juices to drink. All dishes were awesome! The service and atmosphere are also great. It was a bit expensive but understandable for such exquisite food.

        Judging by the queue of people this restaurant is no secret. Luckily we had booked had tried to get a table a few months ago on spec without success. We were taken inside and the restaurant opens up with each room in the house seeming to offer tables. We had a table in a small room upstairs. Service was excellent with the young waiter taking our orders and delivering drinks then our food with pleasant engagement and efficiency. The food was really excellent. We shared banana blossom tacos to start than I had a poke bowl with seitan and my wife had the kebabs. All vegan, all beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. It was one of those meals that when you finished you wish you hadn’t! I cannot recommend this restaurant enough definitely for vegans and if you’re not then you should anyway as it’s just great food! Value for money, great service!

              <p>     First time at Unity Diner and we'll definitely be back! The food is tasty and definitely satisfying/filling with generous portions. We shared the mozzarella sticks (VERY tasty and shoes close to the original), prawn tempura (good texture, but could taste a bit more flavorful), followed by Truffle shuffle burger with chunky fries (a dream!). Cocktails are also a must-try.
